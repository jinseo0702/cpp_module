1. Makefile, main.cpp, Zombie.hpp, Zombie.cpp, ZombieHorde.cpp

2. create a hord of Zombies!
3. Zombie * zombieHorde(int N, std::string name);
It must allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then it has to initialize the zombies, giving each one of them the name passed as paramete. The function returns a pointer to the first zombie.

Implement your own tests to ensure your zombieHorde() function workes as expected. Try to call announce() for each one of the zombies

Don't forget to delete all the zombies and check for memory leaks.
