Hi This is brain

Makefile, main.cpp

> A string variable initialized to "Hi this is brain"
> stringPTR : A pointer to string.
> stringREF : A reference to the string

The program has to print :
> The memory address of the string variable.
> The memory address held by stringPTR
> The memory address held by stringREF

and then : 
> The value of the string variable
> The value pointed to by stringPTR
> The value pointed to by stringREF
