> make a Fixed-pointnumbers

Private members:
-> An integer to store the Fixed-point number value.
-> A static constant integer to store the number of fractional bits. Its-
-value will always be the integer litteral 8.
Public members:
-> A default constructor that initializes the fixed-point value to 0.
-> A copy constructor.
-> A copy assignment operator overload.
-> A destructor.
-> A member function int getRawBits( void ) const; that returns the raw-
-value of the fixed-point value.
-> A member function void setRawBits( int const raw ); that sets the raw-
-value of the fixed-point number.
